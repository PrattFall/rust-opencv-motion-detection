# OpenCV + Rust for Motion Detection

This is just something I'm working on for a personal project. It's more or less
a copy of this tutorial: https://www.codespeedy.com/motion-detection-using-opencv-in-python/

To run you'll need all of the dependencies of rust-opencv

## TODO

- Choose file location/name
- Choose webcam
- Choose detection threshold
- Show timestamp on video
